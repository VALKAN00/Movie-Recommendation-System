# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A machine learning-powered platform that provides **personalized movie recommendations** based on user preferences and historical data. This project combines **classification, clustering, and regression** techniques to analyze movie features and predict what users are most likely to enjoy.

## 📌 Objectives

- Develop a data-driven movie recommendation system.
- Predict movie genres, group similar movies, and estimate ratings using ML.
- Deliver interactive visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎯 **Genre Classification** using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM.
- 🧩 **Clustering** similar movies using K-Means.
- ⭐ **Rating Prediction** with Random Forest Regression.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visual insights.
- 📈 **Cosine Similarity** for content-based recommendations.
- 🧹 Text processing with **Regex**.
- 🗃️ Data stored and managed with **MongoDB**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Regex)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and visualization
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for plotting
- **MongoDB** for managing user/movie data
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, K-Means

## 🧱 System Architecture

- **Data Layer**: Movie, user, and rating datasets stored in MongoDB.
- **Processing Layer**: ML models for recommendation, prediction, and clustering.
- **Presentation Layer**: Visualizations in Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧪 Implementation Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**: Install dependencies and set up Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Data Preparation**: Clean and load datasets.
3. **Model Development**: Train models for classification, clustering, and regression.
4. **Recommendation Logic**: Use similarity measures to suggest movies.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess models using precision, recall, RMSE, etc.
6. **Visualization**: Generate charts for model results and data trends.
7. **Documentation**: Present all work in a well-structured notebook.

## 🧩 Datasets

- **Users Dataset**: Contains user IDs and profiles.
- **Movies Dataset**: Titles, genres, countries, metadata.
- **Ratings Dataset**: User ratings for each movie.

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

- **Data Quality**: Applied preprocessing and normalization.
- **Model Accuracy**: Tuned hyperparameters and tried multiple algorithms.
- **Visualization**: Used Seaborn/Matplotlib for detailed analysis.
- **Recommendation Precision**: Leveraged Cosine Similarity for better results.

## 📚 Results

The system effectively predicts genres, groups similar movies, and forecasts user ratings—offering accurate, user-tailored recommendations through a data-rich interface.


## 📌 Future Work

- Build a front-end interface to interact with the system.
- Integrate a Flask or FastAPI backend to serve live recommendations.
- Add user authentication and feedback loop for better personalization.
